#WARNING: Don't use this project.#

Google updated Launcher2 with Android 4.3 to remove all but one use of private APIs. You are far better off using the most recent copy of the [Launcher2](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher2) code as a base.

Or better yet, use Android 4.4's [Launcher3](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3) code.

## LauncherJellyBean ##

The project contains the code for the Launcher app that ships with Android Jelly Bean (API 16).

Some minor changes were required from this source code to remove the use of private APIs. These changes have been marked by "// AOSP Change"
